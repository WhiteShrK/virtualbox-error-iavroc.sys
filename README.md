Solution to virtual box error. when running hirens boot cd

The amount of RAN allocated to the virtualbox isnot sufficient to run Live CD like hirens boot CD PE. To fix this error you have to add more RAM to the virtual box. For latest virtual box (v7 as of the time of writing)  you need to allocate at least 1.9gb of RAM .
